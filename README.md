MapsIntegration

-   To run the project, in the signeasy folder, run npm install && bower install ; it will run on http://localhost:9000
- 	Images of the countries are the same image and it is not present in all the countries data.
-   There are 2 json files - countries.json and cities.json - one containing all the countries and their latitudes and longitudes and the     other containing the cities of 2 countries. (cities do not contain for all the countries as this is hardcoded data)
-   The values of latitude and longitudes are mocked.
